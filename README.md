# FluffyCreditMenuDK2
Basically a Mod to create a new Credits menu intended for Mod Makers.

The Goal is to make a Template people can easily edit and put into their mods and edit how they want.
I intend to include a Semi Tutorial Along with this so it will be easy for people to Understand the way I structured it and how to easily change it up if needed.


Until I make an actual Release which will still be a little while off, to use this mod or perhaps check on it in its current state.
You can download the Repo as a Zip and Extract it into your Respective Mod Folder for DoorKickers 2 and it Should work as intended.
